# Purview.BuildSdk project behavior and detection

Use this skill when a task asks **why** the SDK applied a behavior automatically, or when adding/moving projects in a repo that relies on the SDK's naming and project-type inference.

## Project-type detection rules

The SDK infers behavior from project names, project contents, and SDK declarations.

### Test detection

A project is treated as a test project when its name ends with `*Test` or `*Tests` and the suffix before `Test(s)` matches a supported testing type such as:

- `Unit`
- `Integration`
- `E2E`
- `EndToEnd`
- `Acceptance`
- `Functional`
- `Performance`
- `Load`
- `Smoke`
- `Stress`
- `Regression`
- `Security`
- `Chaos`
- `Scenario`
- `System`
- `Threat`
- `BlackBox`
- `WhiteBox`
- `Accessibility`
- `Interactive`
- `Environment`
- `Architecture`
- `Contract`

Derived properties:

- `IsTestProject=true`
- `TestingType=<detected suffix>`
- `PurviewTestType=<TestingType>Tests`
- `TargetProjectName=<project name with the test suffix removed>`

### Shared project detection

The SDK recognizes shared project names exactly. These are not generic substring matches.

Shared project names:

- `Shared`
- `SharedFramework`
- `SharedInfrastructure`
- `SharedInfra`
- `SharedUtilities`
- `SharedUtils`
- `SharedLibrary`
- `SharedLib`
- `SharedHelpers`

Shared testing project names:

- `SharedTestingFramework`
- `SharedTestingInfrastructure`
- `SharedTestingInfra`
- `SharedTestingUtilities`
- `SharedTestingUtils`
- `SharedTestingLibrary`
- `SharedTestingLib`
- `SharedTestingHelpers`

Derived flags:

- `IsSharedProject`
- `IsSharedTestingProject`

### SDK/content-based detection

- `IsSdkProject` / `SdkProjectName` come from parsing the project/import `Sdk="..."` declaration
- `IsWebSdkProject=true` for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`
- `IsWorkerSdkProject=true` for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker`
- `IsAspireHostProject=true` when the SDK starts with `Aspire.Sdk.Host` or `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`
- `IsContainerProject=true` when `Dockerfile`, `dockerfile`, or `Dockerfile.dev` exists in the project directory
- `IsCLIProject=true` when the project name ends with `CLI`, `Console`, `CommandLine`, `QuickStart`, or `QuickStarts`

## Namespace and identity behavior

The SDK derives the project identity from `NamespacePrefix` and the project name.

Key behavior:

1. `PurviewLogicalProjectName` is built from `NamespacePrefix` plus the project name, with deduplication when the project name already starts with the namespace tail.
2. `RootNamespace` defaults to `PurviewLogicalProjectName`.
3. Known suffixes are stripped from `RootNamespace`, including shared/shared-testing names and common segments like `Core`, `EF`, `Shared`, `ClientShared`, and `ServiceDefaults`.
4. Test suffixes are removed from `RootNamespace`, so `Acme.Api.UnitTests` still maps back to `Acme.Api`.
5. `AssemblyName` and `PackageId` default to the fully evaluated `RootNamespace` (the canonical default public name) — except when suffix-stripping removed a segment of the logical project name (e.g. `Shared` or `ServiceDefaults`), in which case they use the full `PurviewLogicalProjectName` so those assemblies/packages stay distinct from their parent. Test/shared-testing projects keep their detected suffix in `AssemblyName`/`PackageId` so test assemblies stay distinct. Explicit `AssemblyName`/`PackageId`/`RootNamespace` values always win.
6. The naming defaults are applied during `Sdk.props` evaluation (before the Microsoft SDK computes `TargetName`), so the compiled output name always matches `AssemblyName`.
7. The SDK ships `Purview.BuildSdk.Analyzers` and adds it as an `<Analyzer>` item to every C# project, so its rules (PDS0002 Extensions namespace, PDS0003 explicit types with target-typed `new()`, PDS0004 correct acronym capitalization) surface in both command-line builds and Visual Studio. The code-fix assembly ships beside it and is referenced as an `<Analyzer>` item inside Visual Studio so the IDE discovers its code fixes. `PDS0004` follows .NET naming guidance for well-known framework spellings (`Sql`, `Guid`, `Uuid`, `Url`, `Dns`, `Tcp`, `Http`, `Xml`, `Db`, ...) and exempts them by default — `Db` is exempt so `DbContext`/`DbConnection`/`DbSet` are never flagged (re-enable via `acronym_map = Db:DB`); a small set — `Api`, `Ai`, `Ui`, `Io`, `Os`, `Cpu`, `Gpu`, `Cli`, `Gui`, `Ram`, `Ssh` — is still renamed to uppercase. Members mandated by a contract (interface implementations, base-class overrides) are never renamed. Customise via `dotnet_analyzer_configuration.pds0004.allowed_words` (exempt segments), `.acronym_map` (segment renames, e.g. `Sql:SQL`), and `.allowed_identifiers` (brand names exempted by exact name or word-boundary prefix, first match wins — e.g. `CosmosDb` covers `CosmosDbServer`). All three merge with and override the shipped defaults. The shipped `.editorconfig` treats generated content (`Migrations/`, `*.g.cs`, `Generated/`, `*.Designer.cs`, `obj/`/`bin/`) as `generated_code = true`, and suppresses namespace-conflict diagnostics under `Extensions/` so no `#pragma` suppressions are needed there. A VS code refactoring (`Split extensions class into one class per receiver type`) is offered on static extensions classes that target multiple receiver types: it splits them into one `<ReceiverType>Extensions` class per receiver (a generic `this TBuilder where TBuilder : IHostApplicationBuilder` receiver becomes `HostApplicationBuilderExtensions`) and places each under `Extensions/<receiver namespace>/` so the PDS0002 convention stays satisfied. A companion refactoring (`Move extensions class to conventional location`) is offered on single-receiver extensions classes that are misplaced: it re-paths the file to `Extensions/<receiver namespace>/`, fixes the namespace to the receiver's namespace, and updates `using` directives in other referencing documents so the move compiles.

Do not hand-author alternate namespace conventions unless the repository explicitly opts out of the SDK defaults.

## Automatic project references

The SDK adds project references based on layout conventions.

### Non-test projects

For ordinary non-test, non-shared projects, it automatically looks for sibling shared projects:

- `../Shared*/Shared*.csproj`

It also removes accidental self/shared-testing matches.

### Test projects

For detected test projects, it attempts these target-project paths in order when they exist:

- `../$(TargetProjectName)/$(TargetProjectName).csproj`
- `../../$(TargetProjectName)/$(TargetProjectName).csproj`
- `../src/$(TargetProjectName)/$(TargetProjectName).csproj`
- `../../src/$(TargetProjectName)/$(TargetProjectName).csproj`

It also adds sibling shared-testing project references via:

- `../SharedTesting*/SharedTesting*.csproj`

This is why consistent naming and placement matter so much in repos that use the SDK.

## Automatic framework/package behavior

### For non-test C# projects

- Adds SourceLink unless `DisableSourceLink=true`
- Adds Purview telemetry packages unless `ExcludePurviewTelemetry=true`
- Generates documentation files (`GenerateDocumentationFile=true`) unless explicitly disabled
- Generates `InternalsVisibleTo` attributes unless `DisableAutoInternalsVisibleTo=true`

### For packable projects

- Defaults `GenerateDocumentationFile`, `IncludeSymbols`, `SymbolPackageFormat=snupkg`, `PublishRepositoryUrl`, `EmbedUntrackedSources`, `IncludeSource`, and `DebugType=portable` — only when the consuming project has not supplied a value
- Delivers portable PDBs via the `.snupkg`; the normal `.nupkg` does not receive PDBs unless the project opts in explicitly
- Packs the repository-root `README.md` (registered via `PackageReadmeFile`) when the file exists and `PackageReadmeFile` is unset; skips when a README is already being packed
- Non-packable projects (including web apps) default `WarnOnPackingNonPackableProject=false` so solution-wide pack operations skip them silently

### For Roslyn component (analyzer/source-generator) projects

- Defaults a single `netstandard2.0` target, `LangVersion=latest`, `Nullable=enable`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`, `Deterministic=true`, extended analyzer rules, and SourceLink with `EmbedUntrackedSources=true`
- `IsRoslynComponentOnly` defaults to `true`, excluding normal build output (`IncludeBuildOutput=false`) and setting `IncludeSymbols=false`; no `.symbols.nupkg` or `.snupkg` is produced and the analyzer PDB ships inside the main `.nupkg` under `analyzers/dotnet/cs/` beside the analyzer assembly (`PurviewPackAnalyzerPdb=true`). Set it to `false` for a dual-role component that uses normal library symbol packaging.
- Packable Roslyn components automatically pack the built analyzer assembly (and PDB) into `analyzers/dotnet/cs/`; `SymbolPackageFormat` defaults to the modern `snupkg` if symbols are explicitly opted into
- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*` and `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers` references are defaulted to `PrivateAssets=all` (development-only dependencies) so they never leak into the packed nuspec
- A pack-time validation (`ValidateRoslynComponentCompilerSettings`) fails the pack of a packable Roslyn component if `LangVersion`, `Nullable`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, or `EnforceExtendedAnalyzerRules` is missing; opt out with `DisableRoslynCompilerDefaultsValidation=true`
- `ContinuousIntegrationBuild` is set only by real CI environment variables — packability alone never forces SourceLink's CI-mode dirty-repository checks

### For test and shared-testing projects

- Applies test-friendly `NoWarn` defaults
- Marks projects as not packable/publishable
- Adds substitute/test-data/testing packages based on `SubstituteFramework`, `TestDataFramework`, and `TestingFramework`
- For TUnit test projects, enables Microsoft.Testing.Platform integration properties automatically
- For shared-testing projects, skips the runnable test package and marks them with a skip/category pattern appropriate to the selected test framework

For the default configuration, standard test projects receive:

- `TUnit`
- `TUnit.Mocks`
- `Bogus`
- Microsoft.Testing.Platform integration

Specialized testing dependencies such as `TUnit.Aspire` and `Testcontainers` are still explicit additions by
project purpose.

### For special project types

- CLI projects default to `OutputType=Exe` and include `appsettings*.json` as content
- Container projects enable `InvariantGlobalization`, `PublishAot`, Linux Docker defaults, and container tooling package references
- Web SDK projects get `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.Generated` added to `InterceptorsNamespaces` unless marked as a separate web-project mode
- Aspire host projects default to `OutputType=Exe`

## How to reason about surprising behavior

If the SDK “did something unexpected”, inspect these values first:

- `MSBuildProjectName`
- `NamespacePrefix`
- `PurviewLogicalProjectName`
- `RootNamespace`
- `TestingType`
- `TargetProjectName`
- `SdkProjectName`
- `IsTestProject`
- `IsSharedProject`
- `IsSharedTestingProject`
- `IsContainerProject`
- `IsCLIProject`
- `IsWebSdkProject`
- `IsAspireHostProject`

Prefer explaining behavior from these computed properties rather than from assumptions about folder names alone.

## Guidance for structural changes

When adding or moving projects in a repo using this SDK:

1. Keep the `.csproj` filename equal to its containing directory name unless the repo explicitly disables that validation.
2. Preserve established `src/` and `tests/`-style layouts whenever possible.
3. Use test project suffixes intentionally so auto-detection and auto-references work.
4. Keep shared helpers in exact shared/shared-testing names if you want the corresponding SDK behavior.
5. If you change a naming rule in the SDK, update the README and the shipped skills together.
6. If the question is really about repository policy rather than one computed property, point the user to the
   engineering-principles documentation first, then explain the specific SDK mechanics.
